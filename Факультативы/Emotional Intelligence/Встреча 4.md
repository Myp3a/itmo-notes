- Accept your emotions
- Set goals

### A universal algorithm for self-regulation
1. Notice the emotion
	1. You can choose how to respond only if you're aware of the emotion
	2. Observer the bodily sensations
2. Label (Verbalize) the emotion
	1. Try to distinguish what exactly do you feel
	2. ...
3. Accept your emotions and thoughts
4. Distance from the emotion
	1. What reaction would it produce?
	2. What's my goal?
	3. Is the reaction adequate for the current situation?
5. Choose the right tool

Showing up is an acceptance of your emotions and thoughts, because they are yours. There's nothing bad in them, they are just exist to inform you about something.

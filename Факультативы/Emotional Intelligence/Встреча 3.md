> Life is a dance. Mindfulness is witnessing that dance.

### Goals
Define self-awareness and it's competencies
Explore and practice attention and mindfulness techniques
Analyze and apply strategies for accurate self-assesment
Practice techniques for developing self-confidence

### Self-awareness
- Recognizing a feeling as it happens is a keystone of EI
- Requires an activated neocortex
- Our "neutral mode"
- It's not about discovering deep, dark secrets of unconscious motivations
- It comes from developing a straightforward and honest understanding of yourself

### Practice
Read a case. Make a guess, what would high- and low-self-aware person would behave.

### 4 self-awareness archetypes
|                                  | Low external self-awareness                                                                                                                                                                              | High external self-awareness                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High internal self-awareness** | **Introspectors:** <br>They’re clear on who they are but challenge their own views or search for blind spots by getting feedback from others. This can harm their relationships and limit their success. | **Aware:**<br>They know who they are, what they want to accomplish and seek out and value others’ opinions. This is where leaders begin to fully realize the true benefits of self-awareness.                                     |
| **Low internal self-awareness**  | **Seekers:**<br>They don’t know who they are, what they stand for, or how other people see them. As a result, they might feel stuck or frustrated with their performance and relationships.              | **Pleasers:**<br>They can be so focused on appearing a certain way to others that they can be overlooking what matters to them. Over time, they tend to make choices that aren’t in service of their own success and fulfillment. |

### For the correct self-assessment
- Analyze decisions that you've made throughout the day (ask "what", not "why")
- Ask for the feedback about your performance. Choose the right people for that: those, who have kind attitude to you and have the courage to tell the truth
- Ask yourself: what do I learn today? What can I do tomorrow to become better?
- Learn on your mistakes, make changes for better

### ABC model
1. Activating event
	- *He doesn't call me*
	- What is the activating event?
	- What has happened?
	- What did I do?
	- What did others do?
	- What idea occurred to me?
	- What emotions was I feeling?
2. Belief (thoughts)
	- *It means he doesn't like me*
	- What do I believe about the event?
	- Which of my beliefs are my self-enhancing beliefs, and which ones are self-defeating?
3. Consequences (emotional reaction)
	- *I feel rejected and depressed*
	- Am I feeling anger, anxiety, frustration, self-pity, etc.?
	- Am I behaving in a way that doesn't work for me?
4. Disputing (analysis)
	- What's the evidence that my belief is true?
	- In what ways is my belief helpful or unhelpful?
	- What self-enhancing belief can I use to replace each self-defeating belief?
5. Effect (new thought)
	- Effective new belief and emotional consequence
	- What are my new feelings?

Example questions for disputing beliefs
- How often does it happen?
- What's my interest in thinking this way?
- Why could these thoughts be unproductive?
- What facts/experience support this belief?
- What's the evidence to the contrary?
- What else could be the reason for the situation?
- What could your friend say about it?
- How can you validate your thoughts?
- If the belief is true, what would it mean to you?

### Task
Recall a situation when you failed at something. Not more than 5 out of 10. Formulate and write down 3-5 questions to reflect on this situation. Write down in Telegram chat.

Situation: haven't worked at all a day, was worried about that.
Questions:
- What can I do to recover my work time?
- How can I plan things more effectively?
- What can be done to improve my ability to hand over less important tasks?
- What I can do to make myself less worried?
- What will motivate me to keep working?
Rewrite the questions so there's no "Why" and self-criticism questions.

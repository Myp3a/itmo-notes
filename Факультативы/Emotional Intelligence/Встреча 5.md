### Homework
- Rewrite the case from HW3 and write 4 self-regulation techniques instead of questions
	-  I was at the lesson listening to how to program AI. I understood that there's still a lot to learn and do, and I don't have enough time. I was anxious and in despair.
	- Techniques
		- 5 senses
		- Expressive writing
		- Muscle relaxation
		- Stop-word
- Watch https://youtu.be/RcGyVTAoXEU and answer the questions
	- How do pounding heart and fast breathing help your body to cope with stress?
		- It makes you be ready for the action and brings more oxygen to the brain
    - What is one of the most underappreciated aspects of the stress response?
	    - Stress makes you social. Oxytocin makes you do social-bonding actions and strengthens your heart
    - What were the conclusions of the study, which analyzed the mortality rate of the people who experienced severe stress while taking care of other people and helping them?
	    - Caring about other people makes you resilient to stress
	- How can you avoid the harmful effects of stress?
		- By thinking differently about the stress, that it's useful for your body
    - How could you apply the findings of the studies in the video to your life?
	    - I can think about stress as a good thing and understand that stress makes me want to bring some other people near me to handle this together
    - Do you agree with Kelly McGonigal’s statement “Chasing meaning is better than avoiding discomfort”? Why?
	    - I agree, because stress is inevitable while you are doing something, and while trying to avoid it, you'll probably achieve nothing. However, if you're chasing something that is valuable to you, you'll experience mostly the same amount of stress, but with related benefits of chasing your likings.

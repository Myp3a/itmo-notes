### What motivated you to choose EI course?
*I'm really bad at feeling the emotions, so I wanted to try to study for it. Also, a psychiatrist says that I must master feeling emotions!* 

### Benefits for us
- Understand yourself more deeply
- Adapt effectively to situations as they change
- Express feelings appropriately in constructive ways
- Influence others and solve problems more effectively
- Build and maintain effective relationships
- Focus on purpose and process and increase your productivity
- Improve your mental and physical health

### Set personal goals
- *Understand myself more, what I feel and why do I feel it.*
- *Become better at persuading other people in scenarios where I want to.*
- *Practice speaking to others, especially in English.*

### What is the intelligence?
- General ability for thinking, proceeding information, decision making
- A complex of cognitive abilities
- ...

> Science doesn't agree on what the intelligence is, so one could say that EI doesn't exist.

### Gardner's theory (...smart)
- Bodily-kinestetic **(EI)**
	- Handle objects and move them around, especially your body
- Interpersonal **(EI)**
	- Perception of other people's emotions
- Verbal-linguistic **(EI)**
	- Rhyming
	- Writing, reading
- Logical-mathematical
	- Intellectual intelligence
	- Critical thinking
	- Organization
- Naturalistic
	- Recognizing stuff in real world
- Intrapersonal **(EI)**
	- How do you understand yourself
	- Control thoughts
	- Knowing strengths and weaknesses
- Visual-spatial
	- Visualization of something in your mind
	- Visual interpretation
- Musical
	- Harmony
	- Interpret sounds and pitches
	- Probably playing an instrument

> **Emotional Intelligence** - the ability to monitor one's own and others' feelings and emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to hone your thinking and actions.

### Five core skills model
1. Self-awareness
	1. Knowledge of one's internal states, preferences, resources and intuitions
2. Self-regulation
	1. Managing one's internal states, impulses and resources
3. Motivation
	1. Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals
4. Empathy
	1. Awareness of others' feelings, needs, and concerns
5. Social skills
	1. Adeptness at including desirable responses in others

### Stereotypes and beliefs about emotions
- *A lot of positive emotions can destroy our health. If we don't have negative emotions, we will have them shadowed and affecting our life.*
- *If your thoughts is positive, everything will be fine.*
- *You can't have positive emotions without negative ones.*
- *Love must me mutual.*
- *If everything is fine in your life: a house, some food, some friends, you must be happy.*
- *Fake positive emotions.*
- *If you do something good to people, then it must come back.*
- *If you have something good in the life, then bad things will happen in the future (black and white life stripes).*
- *Kindness is mistreated as weakness.*
- *A smile a day makes the world a better place.*
- *People with positive emotions are shallow.*

### Questions
Five key skills
- In which domains I already have good skills?
- In which ones I still have difficulties?
*Good:*
- *Self-regulation*
	- *I can shadow my emotions away without any immediate problems or force myself to do something*
- *Empathy*
	- *I can feel other people state of mind. I do not understand it really well, but still I'm able to feel them.*
*Bad:*
- *Self-awareness*
	- *I'm very bad at feeling emotions by myself. I do not understand that I feel something and what should I do in that situation.*
- *Motivation*
	- *While I'm good at forcing myself, I'm really bad at motivation. I do not have working tactics about motivating myself in a good way - only by the force.*

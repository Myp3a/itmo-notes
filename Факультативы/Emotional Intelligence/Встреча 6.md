### Are you too stressed to be productive or not stressed enough?
> Our productivity depends on the level of stress. If stress goes too high or low, the productivity reduces.

The performance increases with the level of stress, but only up to certain point.

	- Mindfulness is a body practice too
	- While we don't think about our body when we're overwhelmed, it reacts to the stressors in different ways
	- Anchoring - bringing our attention back to ours bodies, noticing the physical experiences
		- Helps to snap back to reality
		- The quickest and surest way back to present moment when our mind is lost
	- Even unpleasant email could be interpreted as a threat and activate the amygdala
	- Anchoring methods
		- Take a single breath
			- When you're in distress, you're telling yourself a story and believe it. A breath can distance you from that story and get yourself a proper view
		- Pay attention to emotions
			- Engaging with negative emotions brings less mood disorders
			- If you catch emotional information before it's taking control over you, you can redirect it to the proper way
		- Remember that other people have bodies too
			- Empathy gained from observing bodily sensations can help you build better relationships
		- Magnify little pleasures
			- Afternoon coffee, sitting after a long stand, holding a new pen, laughing hard etc.
			- We notice more pain than pleasure, focusing on pleasures can change it
	- Stress is inevitable, but how you interpret and manage it is your ability
